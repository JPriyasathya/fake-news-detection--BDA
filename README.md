# 📰 Fake News Detection (Big Data Analytics Project)

**📌 Project Overview**

🎯 This project focuses on Fake News Detection using Machine Learning techniques. The objective is to build a model that can efficiently classify whether a news headline or article is fake or real based on its textual content. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and accuracy evaluation.

**📚 Problem Statement**

With the rise of misinformation on digital platforms, detecting fake news has become crucial. This system helps identify fake or real news articles using supervised machine learning models, contributing towards reducing misinformation spread.

**⚙️ Workflow Summary**

✅ 1. Data Collection

Used publicly available Fake News dataset containing labeled news articles (real/fake).

✅ 2. Data Preprocessing

Removed unnecessary columns, null values, and performed text cleaning (removing punctuations, lowercasing, stop-word removal, etc.).

✅ 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted basic visualizations to understand class distribution and most frequent words in fake and real news.

✅ 4. Feature Extraction

Applied TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

✅ 5. Model Building

Trained and tested different classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

✅ 6. Model Evaluation

Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for comparison.

✅ 7. Final Model Selection

Selected the model with the highest accuracy and balanced performance metrics for final deployment.
