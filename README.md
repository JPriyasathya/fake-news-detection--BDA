# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection (Python - Machine Learning Project)

**Project Overview**
The project aims to build a Fake News Detection System using Python and Machine Learning techniques. It classifies news articles as Fake or Real using text processing and supervised learning algorithms.

**Multiple machine learning models were implemented and evaluated, including:**

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest Classifier


The model achieves the highest accuracy using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF feature extraction.

**Features**

ðŸ“Œ Text Preprocessing â€” Combines title and text, cleans and processes news articles.

ðŸ“Œ Feature Extraction â€” Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features.

ðŸ“Œ Model Comparison â€” Compares Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and LSTM models.

ðŸ“Œ Model Saving â€” Final pipeline model saved using pickle for reuse.

ðŸ“Œ Performance Metrics â€” Uses accuracy score and classification report to measure model effectiveness.

**Dataset Information**
Dataset sourced from Fake and Real News datasets.
Labeled as:
1 â†’ Real News
0 â†’ Fake News
Dataset is shuffled, preprocessed, and split into 80% training and 20% testing.

**Technologies Used**

ðŸŸ£ Python

ðŸŸ¢ Libraries:

pandas, numpy
scikit-learn
joblib, pickle (for model saving)
